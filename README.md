BACKGROUND
==========
I am an Agile Expert for one of the worlds largest companies. I have worked as Development Manager, Scrum Master and Agile Guru for many different companies and on numerous projects. My love for Agile came from its lightweight, simple interface, but over the last 2-3 years additional complexity layers have been added which has made the Agile framework 'heavy'. 
I often work with teams who have to rely on Excel to generate the various needed charts (burndowns, burnups, cumulative flow, cycle times, etc...) and require handcrafting each time they need a chart generating.
I cannot take credit for the actual charts themselves, but I have built a framework which will allow anyone to generate Agile type charts without having to code any JavaScript.

FAQ
===
* What Agile methodology do you use whilst developing the Agile Charts?
- Kanban with a MMFS. I would love to use Scrum, but I do have a day job which means I won't always be able to work on this project :-(. Once the Agile Charts is in a suitable state I will use it publicly on my site (www.carlbruiners.co.uk) to show the user stories being worked on and the backlog.

* Does Agile Charts come with any ASP / PHP JSON / XML / CSV generating pages?
- Once I have the charts generating everything as expected then I will add the code for ASP.NET and PHP. Agile charts will offer JSON / XML / CSV support

* What browsers is does Agile-charts support?
- Any browser that supports HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

* What technology does The really simple Agile tool use?
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, XML.

* Why are you offering this for free?
- Agile appealed to me because of its simplicity, a lot of the tools I use today are far from being simple. The tools I share is an attempting to revert back to the beliefs that I still harbour, that Agile works best when kept simple.

* So whats the catch?
- There isn't a catch. All I have done is retain the rights to remove the tool for further distribution at a later date. Anyone who is using the tool at that point will not be required to agree to any new T&C's, but they maybe unable to receive further updates to the tool.

* I don't like certain aspects, can I just use some charts instead of all the charts?
Yes. One of the drivers behind the Agile-charts tool was to allow any of the parts to be used independently, this may not always be the case as soon as a new feature is released, but I will refactor code to allow this to happen.
